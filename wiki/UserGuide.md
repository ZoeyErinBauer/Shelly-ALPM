# Why Shelly?

### Shelly is a user centric experience made to streamline the user experience of managing their programs in Arch Linux. It offers a comprehensive user experience to find, install, update, track, and remove software on Linux.

## Installing Shelly

If you have the cachyOS repos or Chaotic AUR repos you can do:

```bash
sudo pacman -S shelly
```


You can use a AUR helper:

```bash
yay -S shelly
```

or

```bash
paru -S shelly
```

## Using Shelly

## Home Page

When you Open shelly you will start on the home page. This Page has three major screens to reference.

Arch News - Sharing the ten most recent articles from https://archlinux.org/news/ allowing you to stay up to date on Arch updates.
Shelly Search - Search all enabled sources (Flatpak, Aur and Packages) in 1 place.
Package Dashboard - A listing of all installs in 3 standard supported formats: AUR, Packages, and Flatpak. Underneath it has the percentage of installs currently up to date.

You can return to the home page at any time by clicking the house in the top left. Finally the search function here will search all sources rather than specifically Packages, AUR, or Flatpak.

This is still a wip feature check in for future updates. 

You can install the AUR package shelly-git to get the latest features. This will match what is currently in the master branch. This is not recommended for regular use as it could have unstable features.
